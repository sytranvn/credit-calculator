# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in Zalo (you can ask your buddy to find the group). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Svelte kit](https://svelte.dev/) the framework we built up on,
  * [Discusstion](https://github.com/sytranvn/credit-calculator/discussions) discuss your ideas to improve our tool
  * Find [Issues](https://github.com/sytranvn/credit-calculator/issues) you can help with. Or report any bugs you found, that also great!
  * Zalo: We're usually there.

## Testing

We test it when we use it. But if you want to add extra unit tests, feel free to open pull requests. Make sure you follow the Svelte standard.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/sytranvn/credit-calculator/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We use JSDocs instead of Typescript. They are different but do the same job. Please add JSDocs to your function whenever posible, that will help others continue improving our tool.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
